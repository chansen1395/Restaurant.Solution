*Best Restaurants*
Create a website where users can add their favorite restaurants based on the type of cuisine they offer.

Add a Cuisine class. Build out all CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for this class. Remember that "Read" means to view a particular cuisine and to list out all of the cuisines.

Add a Restaurant class. Build out all CRUD functionality for this class.

Add properties other than name to your Restaurant class so that you can display descriptive information about the restaurants.

Make the connection between a cuisine and a restaurant in the database. A cuisine can have many restaurants, but a restaurant can only be attached to one cuisine.

Allow a user to search for all of a cuisine's restaurants.

*Further Exploration*
If you have time, go ahead and tackle the next few features.

Now your application allows for users to review restaurants. Build out a Review class and make the relationship in the database so that a restaurant has many reviews. Pretend that the users who are reviewing the website are different from the user who added the restaurant.

Display all of the reviews at the bottom of the restaurant's page.
